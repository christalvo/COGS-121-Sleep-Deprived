We intended to stay close to our original design, and we stuck to it for the time being. We liked the design with two bars, as well as the simple, horizontally-oriented layout. In the future, we may add icons for the different websites (as shown in our paper prototype). We also decided to retain the "time spent on other websites" aspect of the page, but (for now) decided against multpile bars on the screen (as shown in our prototype). We did change the location of logout/settings buttons, however, by placing them at the bottom of the page.  

## Screen 2: Past 24 hours

Our "past day" showcases the data visualization aspect of our app. As we had envisioned in our paper prototype, a user can change an option to see data from a larger period of time (compared with one or a few hours). We also decided to change the wording of the progress bars, from "Yes/No" to a "Play" indicator--a resemblance of how much time the user has spent on non-work websites (such as Netflix).
