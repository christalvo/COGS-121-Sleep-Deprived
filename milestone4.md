We improved on the previous skeleton by creating a "history" division that shows clearly the distinction between the bar above and the history. We also changed the history interaction, and, as shown above, the data may change for each selection. We also changed the history from a descending list to just the two most visited sites within that given time frame.

Our previous settings page did not have much content, so we added options for the user, including a whitelist for sites, work interval, and notifications settings. As with our index page, we made visual changes, including text and button changes. 

## User Privacy
Our app intends to show a user their own usage data of various websites.
We believe that our app informs the user of the data that will be collected (on Chrome), and thus the user may make an informed decision to use or not use our app. 
As such, a user is fully consenting to the collection of said data. All usage data is displayed and stored for the purposes of the user and the user alone.
Finally, our app does not contain any deceptive UI that would cause a user to unintentionally share their data.

We understand fully the need to trust the developers of tools we use to develop our app. The tools we use are reputable, and suggested by our professor.
We did not use any tools that have not been approved for the course.

We understand that data will be shared with our professor, TAs, and classmates. During our final presentation, we will likely use data from one of our developers.
If necessary, we will have that teammate sign an informed consent form that states that their browing data will be shared with our class. 

Because of the thought we have put into ensuring that we develop an app that does not collect or share data without informed consent, we believe that our app respects user privacy adequetely.
