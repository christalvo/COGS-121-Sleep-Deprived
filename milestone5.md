We have replaced our index.html page, and created a chrome extention with a pop-up in its place.

As shown above, our previous design only led to the settings page through the "settings" button on the index page.

In addition, we changed some of the aesthetics of our settings page, primarily the red color. The major change to our settings page is that it is now accessed through the "options" when clicking on our extention icon. 

## User Action 1: Add a website to the whitelist database

By typing into the whitelist add box, and pressing the add button, a new item will be inputted into the whitelist database, powered by Firebase.

## User Action 2: Change time interval
Through a simple drop down menu, a user is able to change the time interval that they wish to be monitored.
