## UI Improvements

First and foremost, we created an icon for our extention and replaced the default icon with our own.

Our UI has changed for both our popup and options page.

In the above, we have added several features to the popup. Our progress bar is now a visualization of data, and no longer a static object.
As well, we added whitelist features to the popup for ease of use. One can add the current site to the whitelist with a click of the "add to whitelist" button.
We also added a "reset database" button to the popup, so one can reset the tracking at any time.

We also clarified usability for the Settings page - no longer do we have a "reset" button, simple a "save" and "delete all." This makes our whitelist settings easier to navigate and manipulate. A user can delete an item from the whitelist, or remove the entire whitelist.

We added an alert that shows the user that the whitelist was added. This is for confirmation and ease of use.

## Visualization

Above is our progress bar visualization that shows the user's proportion of "work" to "play" sites. It will list the user's total time on any site, their time on "non-work" websites, and their time on "work" websites, which the user can choose using the whitelist.

This can be compared to a user that has not used any websites, for example, if a user idles on a new tab page.
