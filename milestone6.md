# Milestone 6

## UI Improvements

Our UI has changed for both our popup and options page.

In the above, we have added several features to the popup. Our progress bar is now a visualization of data, and no longer a static object.
As well, we added whitelist features to the popup for ease of use. One can add the current site to the whitelist with a click of the "add to whitelist" button.
We also added a "reset database" button to the popup, so one can reset the tracking at any time.

We also clarified usability for the Settings page - no longer do we have a "reset" button, simple a "save" and "delete all." This makes our whitelist settings easier to navigate and manipulate. A user can delete an item from the whitelist, or remove the entire whitelist.
